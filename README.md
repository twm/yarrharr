# Yarrharr

Yarrharr is a simple web-based feed reader intended for self-hosting.

## Development

Yarrharr is a Python application, but also a modern web app, so its dependencies are numerous.
The following steps work on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04; some modification may be necessary for Debian.

### Get the Source and Dependencies

Grab the build dependencies with:

    $ sudo apt-get install inkscape icoutils git python-scour optipng \
                           python-dev build-essential

Install [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#get-pip), then install [Tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
(I actually recommend installing this in your home directory, but that's outside the scope of this document.)

Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Check out the repository and the git submodules:

    $ git checkout https://github.com/twm/yarrharr.git
    $ cd yarrharr
    $ git submodule update --init

Next install the frontend build tools:

    $ nvm use
    $ npm install

This will take a minute to produce a ``node_modules`` directory with gobs of JavaScript in it.

### Running the Django Development Server

When doing development you must run separate server processes for the Django backend and the Webpack frontend.

Run the Django development server via Tox with:

    $ make devserver

In another terminal, run the [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) build process with:

    $ make webpack

Feed checks are not done automatically in this mode, but must be triggered manually:

    $ make check-feeds

## Releasing Yarrharr

 1. Bump the version number in ``setup.py``.
 2. Tag the release: ``git tag "v$(python setup.py --version)"``
 3. Type ``make release`` to output a tarball to the ``dist`` directory.
