; Static files are served in two ways in development:
;
; 1. For "make devserver", they are served by Django's development server and
;    this setting is ignored.
;
; 2. For "make realserver", this setting is obeyed. It points directly
;    at the Yarrharr app static file directory (where "make webpack-release"
;    deposits files). This means that it will only serve static files from
;    Yarrharr, which is okay for now as no other apps in use provide static
;    files.
