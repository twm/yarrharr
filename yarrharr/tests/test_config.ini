; Static files are served in two ways in development:
;
; 1. For "make runserver", they are served by Django's development server and
;    this setting is ignored.
;
; 2. For "tox -e run -- yarrharr", this setting is obeyed. It points directly
;    at the Yarrharr app static file directory (where "make webpack" deposits
;    files). This means that it will only serve static files from Yarrharr,
;    which is okay for now as no other apps in use provide static files.
