    """
    An Atom or RSS feed to check for new articles periodically.

    :ivar user: User who owns the feed.
    :ivar url: URL where the feed may be found.
    :ivar added: When was this feed added to the database?
    :ivar deleted:
        When was this feed deleted? None otherwise. Once set this is permanent.
        The feed will eventually be removed from the database once any
        associated data is cleaned up.

    Many fields track information on when to check the feed and it status:

    :ivar next_check:
        Next time we should try checking the feed. To stop checking the feed,
        set this to None.
    :ivar last_checked:
        When did we last try to check the feed? None if never checked.
    :ivar last_updated:
        When did a check find an updated feed? None if the feed has never been
        successfully checked.
    :ivar error: String error message from the last check.
    :ivar etag:
        HTTP ETag from the last check. Empty when the feed does set the header.

        This is the exact bytes sent by the server, though values larger than
        a kibibyte are disallowed.
    :ivar last_modified:
        HTTP Last-Modified header from the last check. Empty when the feed does
        not set the header.

        This is the exact bytes sent by the server. It is a `HTTP date
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1>`_ like ``b'Tue,
        15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT'``, but the length limit is set slightly
        higher to allow for obsolete or non-compliant servers.

    overridden by the user:

    :ivar feed_title: The title as specified in the feed itself.
    :ivar user_title: An optional user override of the feed title.

    These two are combined in the `title` property.
