    Search the Yarrharr app's static directory for the newest file matching the
    given fnmatch pattern.

    This combines with a Webpack output file pattern that incorporates a hash
    of the file contents to ensure that the browser always receives the latest
    file without sending cache-busting headers. Discarding all but the newest
    files is necessary because Webpack's watch mode (used in development)
    doesn't clear files from the output directory (``CleanWebpackPlugin``
    doesn't operate). In production the mtime checking is a no-op, as there is
    exactly one file which matches the pattern.

    Matching is also done with additional ``.gz`` and ``.br`` extensions. These
    are stripped in the return value, as `yarrharr.application.Static` does not
    permit them.
