from django.dispatch import Signal

schedule_changed = Signal()
"""
The `schedule_changed` signal is sent when feeds have been modified in the
database such that the polling schedule may be affected. This includes:

* A feed is created
* A feed is updated (the `Feed.next_check` field changes)
* Feed(s) are deleted

After these events it may be necessary to poll immediately, or to sleep longer.
As the process is already awake and the filesystem cache hot, this is an ideal
time to make that scheduling decision.

This signal must be emitted *after* the transaction which updates the database
has committed to ensure that the schedule changes are visible to the polling
routine.

The sender of this signal is always ``None``.
